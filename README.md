# Hello_world_Flask


This is a simple Hello world program that uses the Flask micro Framework.

The program accepts name dynamically , ie,. It would print any name that is passed post deployment.


To deploy the server, initialize the Flask app by setting the environment variable like

>> set FLASK_APP=%d%.py      ## %d%.py is the name of the python file created

Deployment:

>> flask run


post deployment pass any %name% for the app to print it dynamically.
